            <h2>Project Impact</h2>
            <p>This project demonstrates how machine learning can reduce drilling costs by over <strong>$8.27 million</strong> by optimizing the Rate of Penetration (ROP). Given that drilling is a primary cost in the oil and gas industry, this data-driven solution offers a significant leap in efficiency. Traditional engineering models for ROP prediction, such as the Maurer and B&Y models, have notable limitations, with observed mean errors of 134.0% and 48.6%, respectively. This work introduces a robust machine learning framework that not only predicts ROP with far greater accuracy but also provides a systematic approach to optimize controllable drilling parameters for maximum efficiency and cost savings.</p>

            <p>The project followed a structured workflow, transforming raw well data into an actionable, optimized drilling plan.</p>

                    <h3>1. Data and Pre-processing</h3>
                    <p>The dataset was compiled from four wells (G-92, J-31A, K67Z, C-78) in the Flemish Pass region. It included a comprehensive set of drilling parameters and geological information. The data was cleaned, normalized, and prepared for model training.</p>

                    <p>A detailed feature analysis was conducted using <strong>Spearman Correlation</strong> and <strong>Permutation Feature Importance</strong>. This step was crucial for identifying the most influential parameters on ROP. Key predictors identified include Depth, Standpipe Pressure (SPPA), and Surface Torque (STOR).</p>

                    <p>Advanced regression models, including <strong>Gradient Boosting</strong> and <strong>XGBoost</strong>, were developed to predict ROP. These models were chosen for their high accuracy and ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data. The final model achieved a strong coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of <strong>0.85</strong> on test data.</p>

                    <p><strong>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)</strong>, a powerful metaheuristic algorithm, was applied to the trained machine learning model. PSO systematically searched for the optimal combination of controllable parameters—such as RPM, and Surface Weight on Bit (SWOB)—to maximize the predicted ROP at different depths and geological conditions.</p>

                    <h3>Feature Importance</h3>
                    <p>The analysis of feature importance revealed that <strong>Depth, Standpipe Pressure (SPPA)</strong>, and <strong>Surface Torque (STOR)</strong> are the most influential predictors of ROP. This is consistent with the physics of drilling, as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Depth</strong> is critical because rock formations become more compacted and harder to drill with increasing depth, directly impacting ROP.</li>
                        <li><strong>SPPA</strong> relates to the hydraulic energy used to clean cuttings from the drill bit. Efficient cleaning prevents bit balling and allows for more effective rock cutting.</li>
                        <li><strong>STOR</strong> measures the rotational force required to turn the drill string, which is directly related to the rock's strength and the cutting efficiency at the bit-rock interface.</li>

                    <p>The Spearman Correlation Heat Map effectively demonstrates the relationships between variables. It reveals strong positive correlations between ROP and key controllable parameters like <strong>Surface Weight on Bit (SWOB)</strong> and <strong>Rotations Per Minute (RPM)</strong>. This is expected, as increasing the weight on the bit and the rotational speed are primary methods for enhancing drilling speed. The heatmap also shows inter-correlations between other variables, which informed the feature engineering and selection process.</p>
