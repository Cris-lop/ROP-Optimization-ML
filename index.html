            <h2>Project Impact</h2>
            <p>This project shows how machine learning can reduce drilling costs by over <strong>$5.58 million</strong> by optimizing the Rate of Penetration (ROP). Since drilling is a major expense in the oil and gas industry, this data-driven approach offers a significant improvement in efficiency. Traditional ROP prediction models, such as the Maurer and B&Y models, have substantial limitations, with mean errors of 134.0% and 48.6%, respectively. This work introduces a machine learning framework that delivers much more accurate ROP predictions and provides a clear method for optimizing controllable drilling parameters to maximize efficiency and reduce costs.</p>

            <p>The project followed a structured workflow, transforming raw well data into an actionable, optimized drilling plan.</p>

                    <h3>1. Data and Pre-processing</h3>
                    <p>The dataset was compiled from four wells (G-92, J-31A, K67Z, C-78) in the Flemish Pass region. It included a comprehensive set of drilling parameters and geological information. The data was cleaned, normalized, and prepared for model training.</p>

                    <h3>2. Feature Analysis</h3>
                    <p>A detailed feature analysis was conducted using <strong>Spearman Correlation</strong> and <strong>Permutation Feature Importance</strong>. This step was crucial for identifying the most influential parameters on ROP. Key predictors identified include Depth, Standpipe Pressure (SPPA), and Surface Torque (STOR).</p>

                    <p>Advanced regression models, including <strong>Gradient Boosting</strong> and <strong>XGBoost</strong>, were developed to predict ROP. These models were chosen for their high accuracy and ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data. The final model achieved a strong coefficient of determination (<strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong>) on test data.</p>

                    <p><strong>Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO)</strong>, a powerful metaheuristic algorithm, was applied to the trained machine learning model to identify the optimal combination of controllable parameters—such as RPM and Surface Weight on Bit (SWOB). MOPSO systematically searched for solutions that maximize the predicted ROP while simultaneously optimizing other objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, across different depths and geological conditions. </p>

                    <h3>Feature Importance</h3>
                    <p>The analysis of feature importance revealed that <strong>Depth, Standpipe Pressure (SPPA)</strong>, and <strong>STOR</strong> are the most influential predictors of ROP. This is consistent with the physics of drilling, as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Depth</strong> is critical because rock formations become more compacted and harder to drill with increasing depth, directly impacting ROP.</li>
                        <li><strong>SPPA</strong> relates to the hydraulic energy used to clean cuttings from the drill bit. Efficient cleaning prevents bit balling and allows for more effective rock cutting.</li>
                        <li><strong>STOR</strong> measures the rotational force required to turn the drill string, which is directly related to the rock's strength and the cutting efficiency at the bit-rock interface.</li>

                    <p>The Spearman Correlation Heat Map clearly illustrates the relationships between variables in drilling operations. It shows strong positive correlations between ROP and key controllable parameters like <strong>Surface Weight on Bit (SWOB)</strong> and <strong>Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD)</strong>. This is expected, as increasing SWOB directly increases the force on the drill bit, accelerating the drilling process. ECD also supports faster drilling by maintaining wellbore pressure, ensuring stability, and aiding in hole cleaning.</p>

                    <p> To improve the model’s ability to generalize to new, unseen wells, a more effective validation strategy is needed. The <strong>Leave-One-Well-Out (LOWO)</strong> cross-validation method trains the model on data from three of the four wells and tests it on the remaining, completely unseen well. This process is repeated for each well, offering a thorough evaluation of the model’s real-world performance.</p>

Although the training score is strong, the lower test score highlights the need to improve the model’s generalization. This emphasizes the value of the LOWO approach in detecting and addressing overfitting, ensuring the model is both effective and reliable in practical use.</p>
